# The ROC
Get a random bar from (possibly) the hardest 16 bars ever written - Cam'ron's verse in The ROC

## Usage
Download the binary from the releases page, drop it into your `$HOME/.local/bin` directory (or really wherever on your PATH), and you're good

### Build from source
Clone the repo, compile with `zig build`, and you're done

### Further usage
You can call the binary on terminal startup and show a new bar each time, just call it from your `.<insert shell here>rc` file

## Why?
Why not?
